He is Lizzie Sobinoff’s new boyfriend whom the reality star hid over her IG pictures.</span></p><p><span>Keep reading this Alexander Vega Bio to learn all about him.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Meet Alexander Vega, Lizzie Sobinoff Boyfriend</b></h3><p><span>Alexander Vega first came to light as the mystery man Lizzie Sobinoff was dating during the Christmas holiday 2021. At the time, the reality star uploaded some IG pictures with her new boyfriend but hid his face with heart-eyes emojis to keep his identity under wraps.</span></p><p><span>However, just an emoji over his face wasn’t enough to keep him away from the media’s attention. </span><i><span>Daily Mail</span></i><span> soon figured that the guy was Alexander Vega, they were already together for a few months then.</span></p><p><span>It seems that Alexander and Lizzie preferred to maintain a low-key profile regarding their relationship. And from what little the star shared over her IG, the pair appeared to be happiest and at the best moment of their lives.</span></p><p><span>Before dating Alexander, Lizzie was married to Sib Guilhaus over </span><i><span>Married at First Sight</span></i><span>. However, the pair immediately called it quits within a year in 2020.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“We are both respectful of each other and are still involved in each other’s lives. We’ve cherished each other and have grown together. We would like to send love and well wishes to all,” they shared identical statements at the time.</span></p><p><span>Also, before marrying Sib, Lizzie was partnered with Sam Ball when MAFS fans first met her in 2019. But Sam then went on to infamously have an affair with co-star Ines Basic, and Lizzie didn’t find love that season.</span></p><p><span>Now that </span><i><span>Married at First Sight</span></i><span> season 14 is on its way, fans are wondering if Lizzie would still try her luck again on the show despite already having a boyfriend.

She worked as a store manager before appearing on the reality show and unfortunately suffers from an autoimmune disorder similar to lupus. This was also the reason why she often wore hair extensions to avoid lights around her ears.</span></p><p><span>Talking more about her, Lizzie’s full name is Elizabeth Sobinoff. She is confident, blond, and unapologetically herself. This Sydney native also describes herself as a sentimental person who attached meaning to each piece of jewelry she wears.
