With multiple award nominations, two Grammy Awards, and several other recognitions, there is no exaggerating how talented the 29-year-old is. But outside of <a href=#>her career</a>, Tori also enjoys a lovely relationship with her loved ones, including her husband André Murillo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Betty White Has Been Married Three Times, Who Were Her Husbands?</a></span></p><p>Murillo and Tori tied the knot in May 2018 and have since continued to amaze fans with their beautiful love story. And with a <a href=#>Grammy-winning singer</a> as a wife, Murillo is evidently the ledd famous of the pair. Who is he? What does he do? Read on to find out all this and more.</p><h2 id=he-is-a-taurus><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>He Is A Taurus</span></h2><p>Murillo was born on May 18, 1990, making him fall under the Taurus zodiac sign. Kelly on the other hand is a Sagittarius, with her birthday falling on the 14th of December. According to astrologers, a Taurus and Sagittarius are <a href=#>quite incompatible</a> but have chances of a stable and happy marriage once they understand and accept each other's differences. With three years of marriage down the road, it seems like astrologers got the couple’s horoscope right.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-was-a-professional-basketballer><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>He Was A Professional Basketballer</span></h2><p>André Murillo might not be one a <a href=#>big NBA star,</a> but he is successful in his own right. The 31-year-old is a professional basketball player who started out his career playing for the Hamburg Towers in the German Pro A Basketball League. Murillo would later move to Rostock where he played the power forward position for the Rostock Seawolves. With his exceptional playing skills, Murillo has garnered several awards and recognitions including the NAIA All-American Honorable Mention.</p><h2 id=his-basketball-career-kicked-off-in-high-school><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>His Basketball Career Kicked Off In High School</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Murillo began playing basketball in high school when he attended El Toro High in Lake Forest, California. He then played college basketball at Concordia University. Following his expulsion from the school, Murillo continued playing basketball at Biola University until graduation.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Is Candace Owens's British Husband, George Farmer?</a></span></p><h2 id=he-retired-after-suffering-an-injury><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>He Retired After Suffering An Injury</span></h2><p>In 2019, Murillo <a href=#>announced his retirement</a> from basketball after suffering an injury that left him unable to play basketball. Since retirement, Murillo has continued to enjoy life with his wife and family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=murillo-once-suffered-from-addiction><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Murillo Once Suffered From Addiction</span></h2><p>Murillo was once stabbed at a party, leaving him critically injured. After leaving the hospital, Murilo started using drugs to manage his pain. It was not long before he got addicted. Murillo was soon expelled from Concordia University where he was a student at the time. He would later enroll at Biola University where he says he found God and turned his life around. Dave Holmquist, Murillo’s basketball coach at university, was also reportedly instrumental to the basketballer’s healing journey.</p><h2 id=has-a-net-worth-of-over-800k><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Has A Net Worth Of Over $800k</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It looks like love doesn't care about how much you have in your pocket as long as you're acting right! The handsome basketballer and husband has a net worth of over $800,000. Although his net worth is only about a quarter of Tori’s, who has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an estimated net worth of $3 million</a>, the couple looks happy, and keep growing stronger regardless</p><h2 id=he-is-a-devout-christian><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>He Is A Devout Christian</span></h2><p>André Murillo is a Christian, and he is faith-driven. The basketball player majored in biblical studies and has been big on his beliefs ever since. It is therefore only fitting that his marriage to Tori fully reflects the couple’s beliefs. More often than not, you will find Murillo sharing pictures and posts expressing how amazed he is by God’s works.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Is Ashley Tisdale’s Husband, Christopher French?</a></span></p><h2 id=he-is-a-family-man><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>He Is A Family Man</span></h2><p>André is <a href=#>big on family,</a> and he's not scared to show his social media fans this part of his life. The basketball player adores his wife and never holds back on showering her with love. In addition to Tori, André also seemingly adores his sister Michelle Murillo, his nieces, and his nephews.</p><p>The basketballer’s Instagram is splattered with pictures of his nephews and nieces and while he and Tori are yet to welcome kids of their own, it is quite evident that Murillo will make an amazing father. The couple has a dog, Froddo, whom they completely adore, and who knows, we could have a mini Tori and André soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=murillo-is-very-supportive-of-his-wife><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Murillo Is Very Supportive Of His Wife</span></h2><p>Speaking during a 2019 interview, Tori explained how supportive her husband is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">saying</a>, “The last tour, he was able to come out for that. It was just awesome. He just loves to help. He’s so hands-on. Wherever he is needed he will be there. It’s just really awesome to have him.” The proud husband also supports his wife’s career and regularly promotes her music on his social media.</p><h2 id=he-is-more-outgoing-than-tori><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>He Is More Outgoing Than Tori</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tori might be the star of the family, but Murillo is apparently the more outgoing one of the couple. The singer once admitted that her husband is more outgoing than she is. She further explained that contrary to what it might seem like, she's actually very shy when she's not performing.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Who Is Miranda Lambert’s Husband, Brendan McLoughlin?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuwM6roGajlaG5unnHrqqbmZ6ZeqK6w6ucZqWlp7atuM5o</p></div><div id=links><a href=./dying-light-2-where-to-find-every-easter-egg-weapon.html>&#171;&nbsp;Dying Light 2 - Where to Find Every Easter Egg Weapon</a>
