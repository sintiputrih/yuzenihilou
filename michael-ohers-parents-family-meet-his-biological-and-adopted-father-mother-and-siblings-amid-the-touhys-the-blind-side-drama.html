His family explored amid The Touhys’ ‘The Blind Side’ lawsuit.</h2><p>Michael Oher has become one of the most popular football players of this generation because of his backstory. He spent eight seasons in the&nbsp;NFL, winning a Super Bowl title with the&nbsp;Baltimore Ravens.</p><p>Oher retired from football five years ago, after an impressive career as an offensive tackle. But Oher continues to amaze many even after retirement by helping local communities via his Oher Foundation.</p><p>Oher was also the star attraction and inspiration behind Michael Lewis’ book, ‘The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game.’</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0>Michael Oher’s life story inspired the movie&nbsp;The Blind Side. Almost 14 years after the release of&nbsp;the film, Michael Oher’s family is making headlines once again.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2>On Aug. 14,&nbsp;the retired NFL star&nbsp;whose life inspired the Oscar-nominated film,&nbsp;<a href=#>filed a legal petition to terminate a conservatorship</a>&nbsp;alleging Leigh Anne Tuohy and Sean Tuohy lied about adopting him while making millions off his name.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4>In a filing in the Shelby County, Tenn. probate court, Oher claimed the Tuohy family tricked him into making them his conservators when he was 18, allegedly telling him there was no consequential difference between being adopted and entering into a conservatorship.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8>Oher also alleged in his petition that the Tuohys, including Leigh Anne and Sean’s two children by birth, Collins Tuohy and Sean Tuohy Jr., were paid $225,000 for the 2009 film&nbsp;The Blind Side&nbsp;plus 2.5% of the film’s proceeds, and did not include him in the deal.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10>The Tuohys, however, alleged in their 2010 book,&nbsp;In a Heartbeat: Sharing the Power of Cheerful Giving, that they split the profits “five ways,” according to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>ESPN</a>, who first reported the news.</p><p>Following the lawsuit, many are curious to know more about the athlete’s family; including his biological parents, adoptive guardians and his sibings. Here’s everything to know about Oher and where the Tuohy family is now.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thedistin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/michael-oher-2.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who are Michael Oher’s biological parents?</h2><p>Michael Oher was born on May 28, 1986 in Memphis, Tennessee, United States.</p><p>Oher’s biological parents are Denise Oher (mother) and Michael&nbsp;Jerome Williams (father).</p><p>His mom, Denise, was an alcoholic and crack cocaine addict while his dad, Michael, was usually arrested and jailed.</p><p>His real mother, Denise, had 12 children including “The Blind Side” star.</p><p>While young, he received poor upbringing with little attention or discipline during his childhood. This led him to constantly repeat in school and even attended eleven different schools during his first nine years as a student.</p><p>In 2004 when Oher was in high school, his dad, who was a cellmate of his spouse’s brother, was murdered in jail.</p><p>He was placed in foster care at age seven, and alternated between living in various foster homes and periods of homelessness.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thedistin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Michael-Ohers-Family.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who are Michael Oher’s adoptive parents?</h2><p>At the foster care, Michael Oher was adopted by new couple;&nbsp;Sean Tuohy&nbsp;and&nbsp;Leigh Anne Tuohy&nbsp;when he was 16. At age 17, the Tuohys became Oher’s legal guardians.</p><p>They hired Oher a tutor, who worked with him on schoolwork for 20 hours a week. They were supportive of his talent and became his biggest supporters.</p><p>Oher began playing football during his freshman year at a public high school in Memphis. In his junior year, Oher began to excel in football.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24>Though he received scholarship offers from a number of colleges after high school, Oher ultimately decided to play football at the University of Mississippi, the alma mater of Leigh Anne and Sean. In 2009, he graduated with a degree in criminal justice.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26>That same year, he was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens during the first round of the 2009 NFL Draft. The Tuohy family was by his side for the special honor. The family also cheered on Oher at the 2013 Super Bowl, when the Ravens defeated the San Francisco 49ers. Following his Super Bowl win, Oher played for the Tennessee Titans and Carolina Panthers before retiring from professional football in 2017.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28>Oher’s relationship with the Tuohy family began to fall apart after the release of&nbsp;The Blind Side, which he said bothered him because it depicted him as unintelligent. He then learned he was the only member of the family not receiving royalty checks from the film, his attorney J. Gerard Stranch IV told ESPN.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32>Sean Tuohy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thedistin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Sean-Tuohy-and-Leigh-Anne-Tuohy-and-kids.jpg><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34>Sean (pictured right) was born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana, before attending the University of Mississippi where he played basketball and met his future wife Leigh Anne.

The website adds that he “became a successful entrepreneur building a company that now owns and operates fast food restaurants including Taco Bell, KFC and Freddy’s.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38>Sean and Leigh Anne were the subjects of Michael Lewis’ 2006 book,&nbsp;The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game, and its 2009 feature film adaptation,&nbsp;The Blind Side, which detailed their raising of Oher.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40>Following the film’s release, Sean and Leigh Anne released&nbsp;In a Heartbeat: Sharing the Power of Cheerful Giving&nbsp;and established their charity, The Making it Happen Foundation, which “promotes awareness, provides help, and seeks to improve the standard of living for all the children fighting to survive in the invisible cracks in society,” per Leigh Anne’s website.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42>In February 2013, the Tuohy family was on the sidelines as Oher competed in the Super Bowl with the Baltimore Ravens.&nbsp;Though Sean isn’t very active on social media, fans immediately took notice of how Oher was absent from&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the family’s Easter celebration in 2016</a>. A few months earlier, Sean had posted a photo with Oher, saying&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he was “proud” of him</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44>Leigh Anne Tuohy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thedistin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Sean-Tuohy-and-Leigh-Anne-Tuohy.jpg><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46>Leigh Anne was born and raised in Memphis, Tenn, before attending college at the University of Mississippi.

She also lists herself as a “mother to 3 great kids” on her Instagram bio.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54>Oher has been featured on Leigh Anne’s Instagram in a number of throwback posts, including one from 2021 where&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>she reflected on a big win with the Panthers</a>&nbsp;five years prior. “In the last few years I’ve truly realized we all have an expiration date so live everyday to the fullest!” she captioned the post in part. “Surround yourself with people who are encouraging, inspiring and motivating. Be generous and less judgemental.
