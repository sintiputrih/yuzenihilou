He was born in Los Angeles, California on the 26th August 1989. The NBA all-star is the last child of his parents – he has two older siblings.</p><p>His talent as a basketballer came to fore in his early days at the Artesia High School in Lakewood, California when he joined the school basketball team. In his second year with the team, he recorded an average score of 13.2 points. He improved his performance during his junior year with a record of 18.8 points that propelled his school team to compete and win the state basketball championship.</p><p>His efforts also saw his high school emerge champion in his final year with a record of 33 to 2.

In his first year with the Arizona Sun Devils basketball team. He skillfully put out a record of 3.2 assists, 5.3 rebounds, and 17.8 points pushing his team from their ninth position in the Pac-10 Conference championship to the Fifth position. Their hard work during the tournament got them a spot in National Invitation Tournament for 2008 (NCCA division 1).</p><p>They had a rewarding outing beating the Alabama State University and Southern Illinois Saluki’s men basketball team. Sadly they were knocked out of the championship by 2007/2008 Florida Gator, the national defending champs.</p><p>His outstanding contributions to the overall success of the team got James Harden mentioned as the First-team All Pac-10, Conference All-freshman team, and First-team All-District by the United States Basketball Writers Association and National Association of Basketball Coaches.</p><p>After a fantastic sophomore season, in 2009 he finished it off with 4.2 assists, 5.6 rebounds, and 20.1 average points. The points were enough to get him named as All-Pac 10 Tournament Team, Pacific-10 Conference’s Player of the Year, and a consensus All-American. Feeling all ready for the bigger playing field, James Harden signed up for the 2009 NBA draft with the help Rob Pelinka where was picked as a point guard by Oklahoma City Thunder as a 3rd overall.</p><p>He brought his zest and freshness into the games of his franchise that before his first season finished with the team, he made history in the NBA as the rookie with 4th highest 3-point percentage at the age of 21 years. Therefore, it was not surprising when he was named the NBA All-Rookie Second Team. He continued his exploits earning several awards such as NBA sixth man of the year award among others with Oklahoma City Thunder till 2012 when he became a free agent.</p><p>Although the management of the franchise offered him a contract extension of $52 million to $55 million, Harden and the management did not agree at a price hence he was sold off to Houston Rockets in October 2012.</p><p>The No. 13 shirt of the Houston Rockets inked a mouth-watering contract of $80 million five-year deal. Motivated by his new offer the same day, he made his first game appearance registering 12 assists, 6, rebounds, 4 steals, and a career-high 37 points in the game against the Detroit Piston which his franchise won by 105 to 96 point.</p><p>The above outstanding record made the shooting guard 4th basketball player in 25 years to post double-digit points in a single match and the third highest point for any NBA player debut. Ever since, the athlete has done other remarkable feats for his team thus earning so many recognitions, awards, and even wealth that many of his peers are yet to attempt.</p><p>James Harden was the most valuable player of the year in 2018, 7-time NBA All-Star from 2013 to 2019, 5-time All-NBA first team from 2014, 2015 and 2017 to 2019. As though those were not enough, he was NBA scoring champ two years in a roll (2018 and 2019), the impeccable list goes on.</p><p>No wonder, his brilliance on the courts and comportment got notable companies like Adidas to offer the basketballer a hefty endorsement deal in 2015 worth $200 million for thirteen years. A deal we are sure impacted his net worth to the tune of $165 million.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-his-height-and-weight></span><strong>What Are His Height And Weight?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The remarkable baller has got the skills and technicalities, however, James Harden’s back to back successes on the court is not solely attributed to his skills but also his body build.
