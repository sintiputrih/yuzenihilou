He had famous and successful parents, a dysfunctional childhood, issues with his parents and his upbringing, and resentment of growing up in their shadows, never able to match their fame and fortune.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the moment, he is doing something he calls "art". But we'll get to that later. For a time he had some success as a singer with his now-defunct band Deadsy. Of course, mommy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">(now 70-something Cher)</a> helped him out by taking him on tour with her.</p><p>He's hardly poor, seemingly happily married to a German musician, and now focusing on his "art" career.</p><p>Do he and his mom and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">half brother Chaz Bono</a> have a close and loving relationship? No way. And he has the air of a man who never quite found the place he was looking for.</p><p>So, let's have a look at the man who is Elijah Blue Allman.</p><h2 id=shunned-by-his-parents>Shunned By His Parents</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Actress/singer/activist Cher</a> was married to musician Greg Allman (of Allman Brothers fame) when Elijah Blue was born in 1976. They were both rich, famous and successful. Cher was the third of Allman's eight wives and by the time Elijah Blue was 4-years-old, they had divorced.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But the problem was Greg did drugs. Big time. And Cher thought it best that Elijah Blue was not exposed to him for extended periods of time. So, she packed him off to boarding school when he was only 7-years-old. He has spoken of that, saying <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he felt shunned by his parents</a>. Oh, he visited his parents in New York some weekends, but he felt that he was an outsider. And he resents that. And he is more than a little bit angry about what he sees as abandonment by his parents.</p><p>He has said quite bluntly:&nbsp;"When you go to boarding school at 7 years old, it's kind of hard to feel like you're not being shunned. But I'm at an age where I'm making peace with it because you just have to. But I still...it doesn't mean it's right. It's still wrong to do that." Trust us, the guy does not exactly accentuate the positive. He's a glass-half-empty kind of man.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By the time he was 11-years-old, those visits home to New York included going up to Harlem to get into trouble and buy drugs. He has said: "It's pretty crazy. It seemed normal at the time." His parents' lives were equally "normal". By that time, dad Greg had divorced wife number four, and mom 40-year-old <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cher had enjoyed a fling with boy toy Tom Cruise</a>. He is fourteen years younger than she is. What a life. The idyllic pictures of him with mom Cher and then-half-sister Chastity (now Chaz) paint a very false picture of what was going on. The family was a mess...</p><p>On the one hand, Cher's acting career soared and she won the Best Actress Oscar for 1987's&nbsp;Moonstruck.&nbsp;She was way too busy to notice Elijah Blue. And dad Greg Allman? He was way too busy drinking, partying, doing drugs and chasing women for Elijah Blue to register on his radar. It was totally dysfunctional. And to this day, Elijah Blue resents it and his parents.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">18 Pictures That Change The Way We See Cher</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=music-in-his-blood-and-calling-logos-art>Music In His Blood And Calling Logos Art</h2><p>Elijah Blue got his first guitar from rocker Gene Simmons of Kiss. At 13, he was playing guitar on tour with his mom. How else was he going to ever see her?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Strange Inspired Gene Simmons' Onstage Person In Kiss</a></span></p><p>He mooched around the music circuit, doing some back-up vocals and (usually) unsuccessful auditions to join bands.</p><p>Then, in 1995, industrial rock/heavy rock band Deadsy was formed and Allman adopted the stage name and color of P. Elijah Blue. The band had moderate success, until, like a lot of rock bands, they fell out and went inactive in 2007. In 2017, they did a show or two together and have announced an album will be dropped in 2021. We'll see.</p><p>Lately, Allman has said he is focusing on his "art". There is some longwinded, pseudo-intellectual explanation of what he does, but basically, he strings together logos on colored strips and calls it art.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=back-to-his-personal-life>Back To His Personal Life</h2><p>Dad Greg Allman died in 2107. For a time Elijah Blue lived with Cher, but the old resentments boiled over and he moved out. "Rift" is the word he often uses about what is going on.</p><p>When he was young he had predictable flings with other celeb kids like Nicole Richie. It's what Hollywood brats do. They run in packs.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Little Known Facts About Nicole Richie's Private Life</a></span></p><p>In 2013 he married English musician "Angie" King (a.k.a. Queenie) of the band that is predictably called King. For some reason, Cher doesn't like her much. Maybe it's because she's a lot younger, more attractive, and won't take any guff from her mother-in-law? He says he's happy. But he probably means he's as happy as he's ever going to be. Which isn't very.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, that brings you up to date on Elijah Blue Allman, a.k.a. P. Elijah Blue. Like a lot of celebrity brats, he has mooched around on the periphery of fame and fortune. Reportedly, he and Queenie have a combined&nbsp;net worth&nbsp;of about $16 million, mostly from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his $15 million net worth</a>. So they are not going to starve. But still, he's no Greg Allman or Cher. And, worse still, he knows it.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Kardashian's Obsession With Cher Has Just Turned Her Into A Copycat</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBur8eeqaxlo6S7brHLoqGaoF2XubaxjJqjpaWRo3w%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./bam-adebayo-dating-net-worth-tattoos-smoking-body-facts.html>&#171;&nbsp;Bam Adebayo: dating, net worth, tattoos, smoking &amp;amp; body facts</a>
