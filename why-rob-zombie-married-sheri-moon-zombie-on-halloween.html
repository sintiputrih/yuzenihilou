Rob Zombie And Sheri Moon Zombie Get Married On Halloween?</a></li></ul><ul class=table-content-level-1><li><a href=#>Why People Think Rob Zombie And Sheri Moon Zombie Are Couple Goals</a></li></ul><p>From the moment that Rob Zombie first rose to fame, he has accumulated a huge fan following that can't get enough of his films and music. Since those people adore Rob so much, they do things like spend hours pouring over every element of <a href=#>his music videos looking for Easter eggs</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When a celebrity has such a devoted fanbase the way Rob does, it can be easy for people to forget they are human just like everyone else. After all, before Rob became an icon, he was just a regular guy who <a href=#>had a job working on a classic family show</a>.</p><p>Of course, since Rob certainly has a unique job these days, it probably shouldn't surprise anyone that he does some pretty incredible things. A perfect example of that is Rob gets to make lots of movies with his wife Sheri Moon Zombie, including <a href=#>one that she didn't want to star in at first</a>.</p><p>On top of that, there is no doubt that Rob and Sheri's relationship can be pretty unusual as evidenced by facts like they got married on Halloween. Based on Sheri and Rob's love for the horror genre, fans may assume the couple always wanted a gothic Halloween wedding. In reality, however, fans will likely be surprised to learn why Rob and Sheri tied the knot on October 31st.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-rob-zombie-and-sheri-moon-zombie-get-married-on-halloween>Why Did Rob Zombie And Sheri Moon Zombie Get Married On Halloween?</h2><p>As a musician, songwriter, record producer, scriptwriter, movie producer, and director among other things, Rob Zombie has spent his adult life expressing his inner artist. In order for Rob to be able to do that, he has to be willing to take the risk of putting himself out there to be judged by the masses.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Rob Zombie's The Munsters Is Already Getting Bad Reviews Online</a></span></p><p>Whether observers like any of Rob's projects or not, they have to give him credit for always being true to himself. After all, Rob's projects seem to be extremely personal to who he is as an artist and the things that have influenced him.</p><p>Given that Rob is so willing to expose his inner self, it shouldn't surprise anyone that he typically is very open during interviews. On top of that, since Sheri is a part of practically everything that Rob does, it makes sense that she seems to be equally honest and the couple have been interviewed together many times.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/rob-zombie-and-sheri-moon-zombie-on-the-red-carpet.jpg><p>In 2013, The New York Post spoke to Sheri and Rob for an article that revealed a lot about the couple's relationship that many fans didn't know. A perfect example of that is the couple revealed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what led to them getting married on Halloween</a> in 2002.</p><p>At various points in Rob's career, he appeared in public in outrageous outfits while wearing makeup that drastically changed how he looked. With only that in mind, it certainly seems like Rob should absolutely adore everything about Halloween.</p><p>On top of that, Rob has made a slew of songs that embrace the gothic aesthetic and he has spent his filmmaking career mainly focused on horror films. Heck, Rob made two movies in the Halloween horror film franchise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Sid Haig, The Most Underrated Horror Icon</a></span></p><p>Based on everything that is known about Rob, it seems like a no-brainer that he would get married on Halloween. Similarly, Sheri seems to have the kind of taste that would make it very likely that she would tie the knot on October 31st.</p><p>Despite all of that, when Rob and Sheri spoke to the New York Post, he revealed that the couple didn't get married on Halloween for the reasons people assume.</p><p>“It sounds like we’re trying to be all spooky and weird, but that really wasn’t the plan.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/rob-zombie-and-sheri-moon-zombie-at-movie-premiere.jpg><p>Following up on Rob's remarks, Sheri revealed what the couple's original plans were and how they wound up getting married on the spooky holiday.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“That was kinda by accident. We had our wedding date set for November 9. We’d been together for nine years already, and we had the wedding planner and all that stupid stuff, and we were taking a walk in the neighborhood and were like, ‘Let’s just elope.’ It was the best thing we did. I was so happy.”</p><p>Due to the assumptions that people make about Rob and Sheri, it is funny to learn that they got married on Halloween on the spur of the moment. That said, even though the couple didn't plan to get married on the spooky holiday, it seems safe to assume that they loved the idea of tying the knot on that day.</p><h2 id=why-people-think-rob-zombie-and-sheri-moon-zombie-are-couple-goals>Why People Think Rob Zombie And Sheri Moon Zombie Are Couple Goals</h2><p>Back when Rob Zombie first rose to prominence as White Zombie's frontman, there were a lot of people who thought the worst of him. Of course, some people still harshly judge Rob, but others have completely changed their perception of him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Details About Rob Zombie's Relationship With His Wife, Sheri Moon Zombie</a></span></p><p>While there are several reasons why some people have changed their minds about Rob, one of them stands out. Over the last several years, a lot of people have taken note of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how strong Rob's bond with his wife Sheri is</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/rob-zombie-and-sheri-moon-zombie-on-the-red-carpet.jpg><p>Seemingly always by one another's sides, Rob and Sheri appear to be one of those couples who always want to be together. For a lot of people, spending that much time with anyone would be overwhelming and lead to resentment. For Rob and Sheri, however, they've toured and made movies together for years now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of that, it is amazing to learn that Sheri has made it clear that <a href=#>she only wants to act in movies that Rob makes</a>.</p><p>On top of making that statement, Sheri has stuck by it as well. After all, she has only appeared in one movie that Rob didn't direct. That movie was directed by Rob's friend Tobe Hooper and she starred in it as a favor to him. Sheri also took a pair of TV roles more than a decade ago and one of the episodes she appeared in featured Rob's music.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/rob-zombie-and-sheri-moon-zombie.jpg><p>On top of only working on Rob's movies, there is a myriad of other ways that Sheri's devotion to her husband has been clear for a long time now. Just as importantly, there is absolutely no doubt that Rob is just as devoted to Sheri, and she has also been her muse for a long time now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdp7yjedmopJuhlWK6or7RopydZaOdsrO1jKamqKZdr7yursieZKimXZ2urbjOsJyepl8%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./what-time-is-the-f1-miami-grand-prix-race-in-2024.html>&#171;&nbsp;What Time is the 2024 F1 Miami Grand Prix?</a>
