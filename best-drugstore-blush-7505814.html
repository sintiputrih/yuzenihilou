Some considered it old-fashioned whereas others just didn’t see the need for it when in reality, blush surpasses other beauty products in its versatility alone. With the right technique and formula, you can create the illusion of radiant skin, fake a faux sunkissed glow, and add dimension to your features.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Frankly put, blush is the equivalent of a really great party guest: Fun, reliable, and complementary to every situation. Plus, with its rise in popularity on TikTok as well as all the how to videos from celebrity makeup artists,&nbsp;the well of inspiration for how you can apply it and the looks you can master never runs dry. What’s even better&nbsp;— working with a more affordable drugstore brand gives you a little more leeway to try them all without sacrificing quality.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-milani-baked-blush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Milani Baked Blush</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Milani Baked Blush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ma9C4A3jmKojjsoCJ7gRPn3i7Zs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/milani-baked-blush-6be72f8872cd42918b6334b04e10c8d3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Milani</p></span><p><strong>What We Like: </strong>The blush comes in an extensive shade range, is super buildable, and makes skin glow.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Like: </strong>It could be too shimmery for those who prefer a matte finish.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Recommended by all three of our experts and thousands of TikTok users, we had to get our hands on the Milani Baked Blush – and the results were as dazzling as everyone promised. A glowy, natural color warmed our cheeks with one swipe while the shimmer finish gave our cheekbones an eye-catching allure, making us feel positively radiant.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We are equally impressed with the way the blush blends seamlessly over pores and rough textured skin. Even though we typically turn to creams for the most blendability, creative and editorial makeup artist Anya Tisdale applauds this powder’s buildable formula. This all-star attribute makes the blush conducive for layering it with your other products to create a cohesive, not cakey, makeup look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With 11 shades to choose from, we have no doubt that you’ll find one suitable for your needs, but the aptly named Luminoso is our favorite — its subtle peachy hue looks natural on a variety of skin tones. Each of the colorways leaves behind a satin or shimmer finish that we think provides a gorgeous lit-from-within effect. However, if you’re glitter-averse we recommend opting for the matte finish of Milani’s equally beloved <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">rose powder blush</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades: </strong>11<strong> | Finish: </strong>Satin, shimmery <strong>| Size: </strong>0.16 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-palette-elf-cosmetics-powder-blush-palette></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Palette</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>e.l.f.

Consider taking the warm, top-right brown shade to the inner hallows of our cheeks for added depth, and combining the bottom two pink ones to create a more understated, everyday blush. You can even swatch your lids with any of the four shades for a no-fuss eye makeup application.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The best part? Everyone can enjoy them since the natural-looking shades come in universally flattering rose and peach colors that suit a wide range of skin tones. If you’re skeptical, let us explain: The formula mixes together seamlessly, allowing you to customize a shade that works best for you, and it means you can use this palette every season.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Word to the wise: Use a very light hand when applying these blushes because the color payoff is very strong and can be too intense for more natural looks.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades: </strong>4<strong> | Finish: </strong>Matte, shimmer <strong>| Size: </strong>0.48 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cream-nyx-professional-makeup-sweet-cheeks-soft-cheek-tint></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cream</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>NYX Professional Makeup Sweet Cheeks Soft Cheek Tint</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="NYX Cosmetics Sweet Cheeks Soft Cheek Tint Blush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/8OqReuMuBQYTxbUVD4hx4uxuixk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nyx-cosmetics-sweet-cheeks-soft-cheek-tint-blush-3b3f40b0500a444aa1b6870b442e9902.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>NYX</p></span><p><strong>What We Like: </strong>The creamy formula has hydrating ingredients that feel luxe and lightweight on the skin.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Like: </strong>It can look patchy if you don’t blend it before it dries down.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Calling this pick “small but mighty,” Tisdale swears by the strong color payoff and extensive shade range this blush offers. Enjoy the freeing feeling of going bare-faced, courtesy of its lightweight formula, yet you’ll still reap the benefits of brighter, cheerier skin that the pigmented colors provide.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are also added benefits for your complexion from the inclusion of shea butter and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>glycerin</a>: Two ingredients that not only contribute to an effortless application, but they may help your skin appear softer and more hydrated over time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Feel free to ditch your other makeup tools because the cushioned, doe-foot applicator makes for a super straightforward application — just dot it onto skin and buff. If you are eager to try different techniques à la the sunburn blush trend, know that manipulating the creamy texture with a brush or makeup sponge is just as simple.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although we appreciate how blendable this is upon first application, we recommend working quickly because it dries down fast.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades: </strong>6<strong> | Finish: </strong>Matte <strong>| Size: </strong>0.67 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-mature-skin-makeup-revolution-superdewy-liquid-blusher></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Mature Skin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Makeup Revolution Liquid Blusher</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Makeup Revolution Superdewy Liquid Blush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/eHD-Wn_ARVojSACoy7Imb3uwzB8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/makeup-revolution-superdewy-liquid-blush-f4417189d78047cab13367bf7f0e2b36.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Revolution</p></span><p><strong>What We Like: </strong>The pigmented shades stand out on mature skin without looking too bold.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Like: </strong>The finish isn’t as dewy as the name implies.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’ve discovered some game-changing concealers (thanks, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jamie Lee Curtis</a>) and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>outstanding foundations</a> that enhance mature skin, and now we found a way to add color back into these complexions with this affordable liquid blush from Makeup Revolution.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Simply put, “as people age, their skin tends to get drier and thinner,” explains Gray, who tells us this blush does an excellent job of bringing back radiance with its hydrating formula and pigmented shades. It also “blends like a dream,” she adds, which makes the blush totally customizable. In fact, we found that its ultra-lightweight texture felt similar to applying a silky, luxe serum. This feature made it a delight when we wanted to build the intensity of our look, especially with the shade Flushing For You, which applied to our medium skin like a neutral pink, but lent itself to a brighter, bolder red as we swiped on each layer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The fine-tipped applicator allows you to better control how much you’re using so you can target certain features, like the corner of your cheekbones or the top of your temples. And even though it settles down into a semi-matte finish rather than providing skin with the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>intense luminosity</a> implied by the name Superdewy, we like that it still looks fresh and doesn’t cake on dry skin.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Gray is also a fan of the diverse colorways, specifically calling out the peachy-toned Fake the Flush shade as being very complementary to fair skin and suggesting deeper skin tones try Blush Me Up, a berry-colored hue.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades: </strong>8<strong> | Finish: </strong>Dewy <strong>| Size:</strong> 0.5 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-liquid-nyx-bare-with-me-luminous-cheek-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Liquid</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>NYX Bare With Me Luminous Cheek Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="NYX Bare With Me Luminous Cheek Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/gZwQNY-WkIVlGWrymRFZiyAAqdo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nyx-bare-with-me-luminous-cheek-serum-8257a0ec4f644271a80a9f5d0fe0c967.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p><strong>What We Like: </strong>The liquid formula melts in your skin to provide a natural-looking finish that’s perfect for everyday wear.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Like: </strong>It’s not a very extensive shade range.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A top-notch liquid blush dries fast, won’t transfer, and plays well with our other skincare and makeup products. And this little number from NYX ticks all those boxes and more, says celebrity makeup artist Emily Gray. She recommends this blush over other liquid options because its long-lasting formula is also&nbsp;“extremely lightweight” and “easily blends into the complexion to give a natural flush of color.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The blush seemingly does it all. The finish is dewy, but won’t increase the sheen on an oilier complexion and it glides across the rough, flakier areas of dry skin without skipping or dragging. We partially credit this attribute (and our gleaming skin) to the formula’s use of tremella mushroom, a hydrating plant-based ingredient some experts believe helps the dermis retain moisture.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=2></span></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though there are no pink shades for when we seek that cherub-cheeked glow, we’re overjoyed at how the bronzy shades will fake a beach day better than any self-tanner.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades: </strong>3<strong> | Finish: </strong>Dewy <strong>| Size: </strong>0.33 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-stick-revlon-photoready-insta-blush-stick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Stick</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Revlon Photoready Insta-Blush Stick</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Revlon Photoready Insta-Blush Stick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/mx7O8w-X7FBZxoQ8aLFncicPvRw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/revlon-photoready-insta-blush-stick-9688624dde224dc5a295e1409ada39bf.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>CVS</p></span><p><strong>What We Like: </strong>This travel-friendly stick-style applicator makes application a piece of cake.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Like: </strong>The shades are a little sheer.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Housed in convenient twist-style tubes that lend themselves to easy application, blush sticks are a great option for beginners and no-fuss personalities. Celebrity makeup artist Elizabeth Seropian is a huge fan of blush sticks, and specifically name-checks this Revlon pick as one of her favorites. She tells us there’s no wrong way to apply it (a boon for blush novices), whether it’s “directly to your cheeks and blended out with your fingers,” or with a brush.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And if you feel lost in whether <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>cream vs. powder blush</a> is better, this cream-to-powder formula efficiently quashes the debate.

Tisdale is impressed with how it “diffuses beautifully into the skin,” so we can see why it’s a cult favorite among social media influencers and has even <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>made an appearance on the red carpet</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The secret sauce behind its blendability is the argan oil and vitamin E-infused formula that “moisturizes the skin throughout the day,” says Gray. The plant-based emollients lock in moisture and lend themselves to a more malleable blush you can layer without it clumping. What’s more, the putty texture feels like nothing on your skin and stretches from your dimples to your temple without feeling sticky.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our experts are equally impressed with the shade range, particularly Bali, a warm nude that doubles as a bronzer or contour shade, and Bora Bora, a bright, Barbie pink ideal for springtime looks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It wasn’t easy to fit our larger, fluffier brushes into the small round pot, but since we found the best results patting on the blush with our fingers, this isn’t much of an issue.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades: </strong>8<strong> | Finish: </strong>Semi-matte<strong> | Size: </strong>0.8 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-beginners-wet-n-wild-megaglo-makeup-stick-blush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Beginners</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Wet n Wild MegaGlo Makeup Stick Blush</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Wet n Wild MegaGlo Makeup Stick Blush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/vhtaFEIRp5MEMzqtK0pJYPBIsbo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/wet-n-wild-megaglo-makeup-stick-blush-a9b50c38530a4dc28da52f4219992968.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The multi-faceted tool works well as a blush, contour, and as eye makeup.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s not very long-lasting.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Especially as the beauty world embraces a “more is more” attitude with blush (welcome back<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>, ‘70s glam</a>) there are truly no rules when it comes to how you wear it.

As dry and sensitive skin tends to go hand-in-hand, it’s also nice to see hydrating ingredients like squalane and glycerin on the list for an added bit of luminosity.

She also touts its blendability, weightless feel, and buildable formula — all of which are game-changers for dry skin. It also leaves out alcohol, fragrances, and parabens, so there’s no need to worry about it exacerbating the itchiness or flakiness that sometimes accompanies this skin type.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For only offering the blush in two shades, Catrice made sure they were still pretty universal.

Be sure to blend in an upward motion and take care not to bounce the applicator on your skin, which will “disturb any potential texture,” she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-76 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades:</strong> 2<strong> | Finish: </strong>Matte<strong> | Size:</strong> 0.07 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-powder-maybelline-fit-me-blush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Powder</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Maybelline Fit Me Blush</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Maybelline Fit Me Powder Blush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/OfjrQ-MEjjl4win3aQWQQd2QNgA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/maybelline-fit-me-powder-blush-92a8418f180142a8b94a2014e822a11b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p><strong>What We Like: </strong>The long-lasting powders sweep across all skin textures and provide a gorgeous natural finish.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Like: </strong>Coverage is very light.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Powder blushes can be a gamble: Choose the wrong one and the formula crumbles, clings to dry patches, and looks just plain cakey, but we’re pleased to report the Maybelline Fit Me Powder Blush does just the opposite.

It will also help the rest of your makeup appear cohesive, she says, adding that “if it does not blend well, the blush will be patchy and cling to areas of the face.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Many times a blush, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">e.l.f.

A shimmer shade, for example, can double as a highlighter and be applied along your temples and down the bridge of your nose.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, blushes that dry down to a satin or dewy look are valuable a great options if you’re looking for an extra bit of luminosity and shine, which is something those with dry or mature skin may benefit from using.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, blushes with a matte finish are a failsafe option for all skin types — yes, even drier ones, as long you’re using a lightweight formula, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Maybelline Fit Me Powder Blush</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you prefer a natural look or are still learning how to use blush, when in doubt try to find a one with a sheer finish and buildable formula. According to Gray, “this prevents it from becoming too pigmented,” she says. “Sometimes, once the blush is on the face, it's hard to take the pigment down.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Skin Type</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Here’s the good news: There’s no wrong answer when it comes to what type of blush will look best on your skin and it really depends on what you’re most comfortable with, says Tisdale. “Some people may enjoy using blush over redness on their face, while some people may like using cream blushes, even if they get a bit oily,” she says. The point is: It’s entirely up to you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For example, dabbing on a liquid blush after applying her base makeup is what works best for her oily skin. To prevent it from veering into greasy territory as the day goes on, she sets the look with a dusting of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>powder blush</a> over top. Seropian agrees that a powder blush may work best for oily skin since it “helps to absorb excess oil and prevent shine.” Additionally, with this skin type, she tells us to look for blushes that are “non-comedogenic, and have a matte finish.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dry and mature skin may benefit most from using cream or liquid blushes, says Seropian, especially ones with dewy finishes that contain moisturizing ingredients, such as “hyaluronic acid or glycerin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“For combination skin, it is best to use a versatile blush that can work for both oily and dry areas,” says Seropian. She adds that powder blushes with satin finishes are an excellent option here because they “provide a natural-looking glow without accentuating any dryness or oiliness.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you have sensitive skin or deal with conditions like rosacea, Gray recommends looking “for formulas that do not contain fragrance, alcohol, oils, and parabens as these are going to be the most gentle on the skin.” Avoiding these potential irritations will help prevent a flare-up.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What blush should older women wear?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Since mature skin tends to lean toward the dry side, Seropian recommends using a liquid or cream blush, as it will “leave the skin looking dewy and natural,” she says. These types of formulas are also less likely to skip over wrinkles or settle into fine lines, and instead blend beautifully with textured skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, you’ll have luck finding a blush with hydrating ingredients, like jojoba seed oil, glycerin, and different plant butters that can help restore radiance and moisture, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Burt’s Bees 100% Natural All Aglow Lip & Cheek Stick</a>.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What blush is best for a natural look?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Tisdale opts for liquid blushes when creating a natural look, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">NYX Bare With Me Luminous Cheek Serum</a>.
