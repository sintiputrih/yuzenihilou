For one thing, it's baseless speculation for now that Ash's Gligar will evolve into a Gliscor and have an epic battle with Paul's. Another thing is that Paul is a <i>secondary</i> character, not a <i>primary</i> character like Ash, Misty, Brock, Jessie, James, May, Tracey or Dawn. Those characters can get away with having an article about a minor Pokémon they had, since they've appeared in a majority of the episodes. Paul, on the other hand, is the equivalent of Gary. I don't see a page for every single one of Gary's Pokémon. The only pages we have for Gary's Pokémon are ones that are considered important (ie, <a href=# title="Gary's Blastoise">Blastoise</a>, his starter; <a href=# title="Gary's Arcanine">Arcanine</a>, one of the first Pokémon he was shown to have and one of the more prominent ones with at least three different appearances that I can think of; and <a href=# title="Gary's Umbreon">Umbreon</a> and Nidoqueen, both of which have been prominent in more than one appearance; however, I still feel that Gary's Dodrio and <a href=# title="Gary's Electivire">Electivire</a> are completely unnecessary, but that's another argument). Do you see what I mean? Secondary characters such as Paul, Drew, Harley, Zoey, Kenny and Gary <b>do not</b> need an article about every single Pokémon they own. This article is included. --<a href=# title="User:PAK Man">PAK Man</a> <a href=# title="User talk:PAK Man">Talk</a> 18:47, 16 February 2008 (UTC) Not sure if this is the right place to discuss this. But I like the idea that we fix the Character's Article and put each Pokemon they have separate and put a small description about them, that way they don't get an article. Only of course if it's a big deal that they have a whole article deticated to themselves. If no one really cares though if the Pokemon does have their own article or not, then it's fine the way it is. --<a href=# class=new title="User:Dman dustin (page does not exist)">Dman dustin</a> 06:23, 7 April 2008 (UTC)<p>As a matter of fact, if there WAS an arcticle for every one of Gary's pokémon, there would be 200+ articles starting with "Gary's" and several about the same species. - <i>unsigned comment from <a href=# title=User:Sk8torchic>Sk8torchic</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:Sk8torchic">talk</a> • <a href=# title=Special:Contributions/Sk8torchic>contribs</a>)</i></p>We wouldn't do that.

Master? They are not even in the same class. Arbok and Weezing belonged to main characters and appeared in many episodes. How many did Paul's Gliscor appear in, like three? It's not about whether it did anything recently but what it did during its appearances. Gliscor... really hasn't done that much. Do we even know if Paul still has it? And to Hikaru Wazana, Janovy is Trip's main Pokémon, therefor it is allowed to have it's own article. I can guarantee you that it will have far more appearances than Gliscor ever did.
