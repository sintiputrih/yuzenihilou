While she may not be one to talk about leadership, she leads by example, the one on whose shoulders the real gravitas for rallying the troops rests. Elora is blessed with a cold resolve that belies her age. After losing her mother at the age of three, she carries the scars of her loss like a badge of honor and is determined to break away from the hold of the Reservation into a better life.

Her urban native era hats stand her out as the most stylish of the bunch with a personality that brings the much-needed color and panache to an often stoic team. Willie is also the most eccentric of the lot, having a thing for the supernatural when she asks Elora's uncle to put a curse on Jackie.
