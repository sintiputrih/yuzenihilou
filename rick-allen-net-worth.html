1963, in Dronfield, Derbyshire, England, and is a musician and drummer, best known as a member of the hard rock band Def Leppard since its formation in 1978, effectively the start of his career.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Rick Allen is as of early 2017? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Allen’s net worth is as high as $50 million, an amount earned through his successful career in music.</p><h3>Rick Allen Net Worth $50 Million</h3><p>Rick Allen started playing drums at the age of nine and performed in bands called Smokey Blue, the Johnny Kalendar Band, and Rampant. His mother replied to an ad posted by the band Def Leppard searching for a new drummer, so in 1978 Allen joined them after leaving high school.</p><p>Until 1980, Def Leppard performed as a support to Sammy Hagar and AC/DC, before in 1980 releasing their debut album called “On Through the Night”; this achieved platinum status with over 1 million sales, and it reached No. 51 on the Billboard 200 and No. 15 on UK Albums Chart, while singles “Wasted” and “Hello America” peaked at No. 61 and No. 45 on the UK Singles Chart. The next year, the band recorded their second studio album – “High ‘n’ Dry” – which achieved double platinum status and reached No. 38 on the Billboard 200 and No. 26 on UK Albums Charts. The songs “Let It Go” and “Bringin’ On the Heartbreak” were placed at No. 34 on Mainstream Rock and No. 61 on Billboard Hot 100 charts. So this early in his career, Allen became a millionaire, along with other fellow members.</p><p>The band released two more albums by the end of the ‘80s, both of which achieved diamond status with over 10 million and 12 million records sold respectively in the US. In 1983, they launched “Pyromania”, which reached No. 2 on Billboard 200 and No. 18 on UK Albums Chart, while the singles “Photograph” and “Rock of Ages” topped the Mainstream Rock chart and entered the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p><p>Rick Allen survived an automobile accident on the 31st December 1984, when he lost control of his Corvette and hit a dry stone, losing his left arm as a result, while his girlfriend Miriam Barendsen only suffered some bruising. Although he thought about retirement, Allen’s friends and colleagues persuaded him to continue with playing the drums.</p><p>In 1987, Rick Allen and Def Leppard recorded their most successful album to date, entitled “Hysteria”, which sold over 25 million copies and achieved 12x platinum status in the US alone. It also topped both US Billboard 200 and UK Top 40 charts, while singles “Love Bites” topped the US Billboard Hot 100, and “Pour Some Sugar on Me”, “Armageddon It” and “Hysteria” entered the top 10 on the US Billboard Hot chart, which only increased Rick’s net worth.</p><p>In 1992, Def Leppard released their fifth studio album “Adrenalize”, the band’s last platinum album, with over three million sales in America. It topped both US Billboard 200 and UK Albums Chart, while the songs “Let’s Get Rocked”, “Tonight”, and “Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad” were most popular on the album. Their next two albums: “Slang” (1996) and “Euphoria” (1999) failed to achieve platinum status, but were placed relatively highly on the Billboard 200 chart. In the 2000s, the band recorded a pair of albums, “X” (2002) and “Songs from the Sparkle Lounge” (2008), and most recently, the self-titled “Def Leppard” album came out in 2015.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Rick Allen was married to Stacey from 1991 to 2000, and he has a daughter with her, but divorce followed an arrest for spousal abuse. In October 2003, Allen married Lauren Monroe and has a daughter with her as well.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table class=trademarks readability=1><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>Famously plays with one arm having lost the other in a car accident</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=22.775098149187><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=10><td>1</td><td>On 23 October 1995, he (as a member of Def Leppard) performed a concert in Tangier, Morocco; then later that same day the band performed in London, England; then that night they performed again in Vancouver, Canada.
