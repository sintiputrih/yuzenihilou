It’s only natural that fans are beyond excited to know more about the cast of this season. Today, we bring to you an article about Romeo Escobar, a pageant by profession, and a contestant of Survivor Season 42.</p><p>Read until the end to know about Romeo’s Survivor stint, his partner, job, and more.</p><h3><strong>Romeo Escobar On Survivor 42</strong></h3><p>A little quick overview of the show: Survivor brings a group of strangers together in an isolated location–the Mamanuca Islands off the coast of Fiji for this season–where they must find food and shelter by themselves. In every episode, the cast battle with each other high-intensity challenges, which tests either player’s physical or mental abilities. One contestant is eliminated every episode and the one that survives until the end is given the title of “Sole Survivor” and a handsome cash prize.</p><p>Romeo first announced he was participating in the 42nd season of Survivor on February 10, 2022. He shared a short promotional video on his Instagram and asked his fans and followers to tune into CBS on March 9, 2022, and support him.</p><p>Talking with Parade, Romeo talked about one life experience that he thinks prepared him the most for the game. He revealed that as an immigrant in the US, people don’t expect more from him. He said, “I feel that a lot of times, people don’t expect a lot from people like myself. And so I feel that I’ve been able to overcome all those stereotypes…your past does not dictate your destiny.”</p><p>While Romeo is going strong in the show, one contestant, Zach, is already eliminated. What happened was that the Ika tribe fell behind during the immunity challenge leaving the puzzlers forced to catch up. Zach and Tori were the ones left with the puzzle. All credit to Tori’s social skills, she convinced the rest of the contestants to vote out Zach. The vote against Zach was the first unanimous vote in Survivor’s history.</p><p>In case you did not know, Survivor 42 had an openly trans player, <a href=#>Jackson Fox</a>, as a contestant. Unfortunately, Jackson had to be pulled out of the game for medical reasons. Jackson was on lithium medication and had weaned off the medicine shortly before the show’s production so that it would not be an issue. Contrary to what he thought, the medical tests showed that he was not yet ready to stop taking lithium. Ultimately, Jackson had to leave the show.</p><h3><strong>Romeo Escobar Job</strong></h3><p>As per Romeo Escobar’s bio on CBS, he is a pageant director by profession.
