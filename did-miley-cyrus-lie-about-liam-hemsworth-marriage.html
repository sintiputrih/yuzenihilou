However, the interview quickly went in an unexpected direction when she revealed some information that came as a total shock. Here's whether the singer told a lie.</p><h2 id=did-miley-cyrus-lie-about-marrying-liam-hemsworth>Did Miley Cyrus Lie About Marrying Liam Hemsworth?</h2><p>From a <a href=#>rumored Liam Hemsworth/Jennifer Lawrence affair</a> to what actually went wrong, fans still think about Liam Hemsworth and Miley Cyrus a lot. As far as celebrity love stories go, their romance was absolutely one of the most popular. Ever since they met on the set of the Nicholas Sparks movie The Last Song, the world felt compelled to hear more about this relationship.</p><p>Of course, Miley Cyrus gave many interviews about her famous partner. She never seemed to mind talking about him. She might have realized that people were going to keep asking questions and so she might as well be an open book. At the same time, though, the singer has always been known as a brave and rebellious person who says what she is feeling inside.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/miley-cyrus-denied-cheating-allegations-but-fans-uncovered-clues-hinting-at-a-liam-hemsworth-and-jennifer-lawrence-affair.jpg><p>However, in one interview about a decade ago, the star said something that confused everyone.</p><p>According to Buzzfeed, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miley Cyrus said she was married</a> to Liam Hemsworth in 2013 when she was interviewed by Cosmopolitan. She explained, "I'm happy I don't have to date anyone.

As far as everyone knew, Hemsworth and Cyrus weren't actually husband and wife. If they had already gotten married, there is no way that their fans wouldn't have known about it.

Neither Cyrus nor Hemsworth has commented on the lie. People can only make a few educated guesses about what Cyrus was thinking at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/miley-cyrus-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since the couple had been together for a few years by the time of Cyrus's Cosmopolitan interview in 2013, it's possible that Cyrus felt that she was already essentially married to Hemsworth. They had shared so much of their lives by then, and they were very serious about each other. She might have been thinking about how close she felt to him and how she knew that they wanted to spend their entire lives together.</p><p>It's also telling that Cyrus made a comment about being glad to be out of the dating scene. Since she was engaged at the time of this interview, she might have felt more married than single.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/liam-hemsworth-and-miley-cyrus.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The singer has spoken very candidly in a number of publications about everything ranging from her career to her family to her divorce. She might not have even meant to say that she was married. Maybe she reflected on the conversation later and realized that she made a mistake... or maybe she didn't even remember what she said because she talks to the media so often. But, of course, since Cyrus is so famous, her comments made the rounds quickly and people were surprised by what she had said.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Miley Cyrus And Liam Hemsworth Have A Prenup For A Specific Reason?</a></span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Liam Hemsworth and Miley Cyrus had a long relationship</a> that featured a lot of splitting up and getting back together. According to People, they began seeing each other in 2009, broke up in 2010, and reunited a little while later only to split up once again. While everything seemed to be going well when they shared their engagement news in 2012, they decided that getting married wasn't the best idea after all in 2013.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mley-cyrus-and-liam-hemsworth.jpg><p>After a second engagement in 2016, the couple did get married on December 23rd, 2018.

According to Entertainment Tonight, she described that she was using substances and very unhappy during the last part of their relationship. She called it "playing house" but knew that it wasn't the right fit. Cyrus said, "I think that’s really what, ultimately, getting married was for me.

Instead of saying that she hadn't slept with anyone before, Cyrus said that she had. She was worried that Hemsworth would think she was "a loser."
