The channel was created on August 3, 2018, and has been able to garner 739,534 views until now.</p><p>His second is also slowly gaining popularity but is not as popular as his first or main YouTube channel. This channel also features funny videos which most likely entertain his fans and supporters.</p><p>Moreover, he also posted a video about revealing his face. But he never revealed his face in that video as well. There were his friends claiming that they were at him but at the end of the video, he appeared but never revealed his face to his fans and viewers.</p><p>Furthermore, Khe along with FPS DIESEL, and WildSpartanz have a podcast called “Loud Mouths”.

The way he appears in front of the camera has raised a lot of curiosity among his fans and viewers.</p><p>It has most likely contributed to his mystery quotient and popularity. It is not known until now why he prefers to hide his face from his fans. However, FPSDiesel, one of the fellow YouTubers, and his friend as well said that it could be because of his acne.</p><p>But this statement has neither been confirmed nor denied by himself. So, we cannot be sure if this is true or not.</p><p>Further, there was also a rumor that he did not have legs. And what the viewers and fans see as his legs are prosthetics. However, he proved them all wrong by posting pictures showing his legs which were real and were his legs and not prosthetics.</p><p>Moreover, he doesn’t even show his face to any of his fans so, being secretive about his love life is a normal thing.</p><h2><span id=Kwite_8211_Body_Measurements>Kwite – Body Measurements</span></h2><p>The body measurements of Kwite such as height, weight, chest size, waist size, hip size, and many other sizes are not available at the moment.
