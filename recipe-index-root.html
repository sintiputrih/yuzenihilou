My husband Jack LOVES mushrooms, and I love making risotto for date nights. They’re those rare occasions when you actually want to stand at the stove, stirring and stirring and stirring, because you’re also spending time with someone you love. The fact that all that stirring results in a comforting, flavorful meal is just the cherry on top. Realistically, we probably won’t make this mushroom risotto for Valentine’s Day this year (thinking it would be hard to pull off with a toddler running around!).

It’s budget-friendly, easy to make, and comforting in the way that only pasta with red sauce can be. Though this lentil pasta recipe is full of Italian flavors (marinara! balsamic!
