Epiphany from General Hospital changed her diet, cut out carbs, and ate more proteins, and as for the exercise regime, she rode bikes every day. The weight loss process was a change in lifestyle for Sonya Eddy which was not about vanity but about feeling healthy and comfortable.&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Sonya Eddy</strong> was an American <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>actress</strong></a> who is mostly recognized for playing the character of Epiphany Johnson on General Hospital. She started out in the show in a recurring role in 2006 and was later promoted to a regular cast member in the spin-off General Hospital: Night Shift. She is also known for playing Tammy in the truTV comedy series Those Who Can't from 2016 to 2019. She had a recurring role in Joan of Arcadia from 2004 to 2005.</p><p>The actress started her acting career on Broadway in 1990 when she appeared in <strong>Ruby Dee</strong>'s play Zora is My Name. Some of her stage credits included The Comedy of Errors, The Witch in <strong>Stephen Sondheim</strong>'s Into the Woods, and Bloody Mary in South Pacific. Starting out as a theater actor, now she has appeared in sitcoms such as Married... with Children, The Drew Carey Show, Murphy Brown, Seinfeld, and Home Improvement.</p><p>She has done a lot of shows and plays in her acting career. But rather than getting the due appreciation for the brilliance with which she portrays different characters, she often becomes the talk among the people for her size and weight. She had always been a big girl and unfortunately, that has overshadowed her talent. It was such a big deal in 2018 when she underwent weight loss that people are still talking about that now even after she's gone. Continue reading to find out more about Sonya Eddy's weight loss!</p><p>Previously, we touched on the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>weight loss</a></strong> stories of <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Ethan Suplee</strong></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Shania Twain</strong></a>.</p><h2>Sonya Eddy's Weight Loss: Check Out The General Hospital Cast's Diets and Exercise Regime She Followed to Lose 60 Pounds!</h2><p><strong>Sonya Eddy</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@sonyaeddy</a>) never had it easy in showbiz because of her weight. She would fall under the category of an overweight person and that has taken away so many things from her like the due appreciation that she deserves for her strong performances in several television shows and Broadways. Her weight always stole her acting talent's thunder. Her size preceded all kinds of discussions about her and it still does, even after <a href=# rel=noopener>her death</a>. So, it was a big deal when she underwent a weight loss of <strong>60 pounds</strong> in 2018.</p><p>In that instance, that weight loss made more noise and made more headlines than anything about her acting career ever did, which is very unfortunate. But it is what it is. She <a href=# rel=noopener>lost 60 pounds </a>and gained too much attention after that. It might have been a little too offensive if it wasn't so big a deal for Sonya Eddy but it was a change of lifestyle for her. She is 5 feet 4 inches tall which made her look too big and when she shed 60 pounds, she visibly transformed.</p><p>At the end of 2018, Sonya Eddy surprised General Hospital fans when she came on the screen looking noticeably slimmer than before. It had been a while since she was last seen in the show, so the weight loss transformation was even more pronounced and visible. The efforts she made to lose all that weight were not easy.</p><p>The Those Who Can't star opened up about what she did in order to lose that 60 pounds that transformed her in an interview and it was all about eating healthy and moving around more. She got started on the weight loss journey because she was not feeling comfortable and healthy at her weight. So, she wanted to change that and in that process, she made changes to her diet and added an exercise schedule to her daily routine and hence, changed the way she lived.</p><p>It might seem simple but it was certainly not easy for Sonya Eddy. She watched what she ate to control her eating habits and she really made an effort in getting off her butt to move around to not stay idle as some sort of physical activity. As she explained,</p><p><strong>I hate the gym with a passion, but I try to ride my bike every other day. I put my four little dogs in the basket and go!</strong></p><p>Besides that, Sonya Eddy also made other changes such as putting the groceries right away after shopping which helped her in weight loss tremendously. She said that it also helped her metabolism when she walked around.</p><p><strong>When I’m running between the refrigerator, the garage, and all, it does something to my metabolism — and then I’m not grazing! I’m just always going now. We’re talking about an attitude and behavior change. I fail on a daily basis, but I try hard to stick it out.</strong></p><p>It was hard for her to make those changes but Sonya Eddy powered through to make the change in her lifestyle last because it was so much to her. It meant feeling comfortable with her body. It was not about vanity and looking nice by losing weight. She cut out carbs and ate lots of protein and salads for weight loss because it was a matter of her health.</p><p><strong>I’ve always thought I was cute any damn way. But I remember how horrible I felt [physically] last year. I don’t want to feel like that anymore!</strong></p><p><strong>Visit <a href=#>House & Whips</a>&nbsp;for more&nbsp;<a href=#>interesting stories</a> about your favorite celebs.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGiqqKaplnqmsMOyZLCdmZy1tXnLqKqsZw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./erica-herman.html>&#171;&nbsp;Erica Herman- Net worth, Husband, Bio, Age, Height, Ethnicity</a>
