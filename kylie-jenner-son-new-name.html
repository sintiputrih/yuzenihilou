Although the former member of the Kardashian family hasn’t made any announcements yet, admirers have found some hints and offered their theories.</p><h3>Why Did Kylie Jenner Change Her Son’s Name?</h3><p>The mother of two explained why she chose the name Wolf for her son in the first place and how she quickly came to regret it. During season 2 of The Kardashians, Kylie said, “We didn’t have a name [when he was born].” “When we first met him, I assumed it would just come to us, but it didn’t. We had 24 hours to sign the birth certificate before it was used to register the child without a name and without a social security number. I sensed pressure to select a name.</p><p>The new mother used the name Wolf Webster at “that instant” after Khloé Kardashian proposed it and Kylie loved the letters “WW.”</p><p>But as soon as I had signed the birth certificate, I thought, “What have I done?” His name has changed, but it’s still a part of his story,” Kylie continued.</p><h3>What Is Kylie Jenner’s Son’s Name?</h3><p>Kylie is nearly finished choosing her son’s name, according to sister Kim Kardashian, who made this revelation on Live With Kelly and Ryan on April 15. There is one name that keeps coming up, but she wants to be certain. Really, it’s such a significant choice. Naming a child is the toughest thing anyone has ever done in life.</p><p>Social media users offered suggestions for the newborn boy’s new name after a Reddit user told others of Kylie’s March 21 announcement, in which she and the “Goosebumps” rapper said they “didn’t really feel like [Wolf] was him.”</p><p>“I support Jack. One guy asserted, “It was always supposed to be Jacques. Another chimed on, referring to Kylie and Travis’ emotional YouTube video dedicated to their child and detailing her pregnancy experience, “After the ‘To My Son’ video, there’s no way it isn’t Jack.”</p><p>Others noted that the title was likely because it matched Travis’ given name. Another fan added in, “Since he’s born on 2/2/2022 and [Travis is] Jacques II, I’d go with Jaques Deuce,” while other others praised the notion and even suggested the French word “Deux” as a potential middle name.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Kylie-Jenner-Travis-Scott-Son-New-Name-576x1024.jpg alt width=576 height=1024 sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>The ex-friend of Kylie, Tammy Hembrow, who also has a son named Wolf and a daughter named Saskia, was a hot topic of discussion.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u78e9f4e9ff80324f2605fcbf0ac292c3><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Kylie Jenner's Son's Name & First Picture Shared By Her</span></a><p>Below the Jacques supporters, a Reddit member wrote, “I feel this is due of Tammy Hembrow.” Another individual retorted, “That’s exactly why. Everyone will argue that this is not the cause. She wouldn’t want it to appear that she was imitating someone. She naively believed that nobody would notice.</p><p>Kylie and Tammy were close friends up until February 2019, when rumours that the blonde beauty had hooked up with Kylie’s ex Tyga while he was on tour in Australia in January of that year surfaced. After that, Kylie stopped following the Australian user on Instagram. Tyga declined to respond when questioned about their apparent connection, and Tammy’s representatives denied that she was involved romantically with the rapper at the time.</p><h3>Is Kylie Jenner’s Son Named Angel?</h3><p>The Kardashian-Jenner family and a few prominent friends accidentally created rumours that Kylie named her son Angel after disclosing his birth in a February 6 Instagram post, but aside from the odd names, one user said they were “still cheering for Angel.”</p><p>Momager Kris Jenner remarked on the monochrome image, “Angel Pie.” Ariel Tejada, Kylie’s makeup artist, wrote: “Can’t wait to meet the little angel.” Stassie Karanikolaou, the Life of Kylie alum’s best friend, chimed in, “Angel baby.”</p><p>In addition to trolls stoking the “angelic” rumours, Kylie even embroidered “Angel baby” on a craft during her baby shower on January 14.</p><p>On July 23, Kylie uploaded a TikTok video showing only her infant son’s little feet as she approached their garden, which had a “Sage” sign in it. This was interpreted by followers as a clue about her son’s new name, and they commented on the post to express their opinions.</p><p>Sage is the name, right? a user posted. Another person responded, “Two S’s. Stormi and Sage,” while a third said, “That’s what I thought, so I came to the comments to check who else felt the same.”</p><p>0 of 21 seconds, 0% of the volume Loading ad</p><p>Kylie switched the camera over to a second sign after “Sage” that read “Curly Kale,” although many others noted that the name they read was probably just a clue to their garden.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u86e57c2985b69a8f21649cc0f90f351b><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Kylie Jenner's Son's Name & First Picture Shared By Her</span></a><p>New online rumours regarding the name of Kylie and Travis’ son are expected to surface in August. During a fan Q&A with DeuxMoi, a fan asked, “Any clue on what Kylie ended up calling her baby?” I have heard a name, but I’m not sure if it’s accurate. The name might be a noun or an adjective depending on how she spells it, the account replied.</p><p>Another idea holds that the name Knight Jacques Webster was revealed via an Instagram account thought to belong to Mason Kardashian, the oldest son of Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick.</p><p>In a post honouring Kylie’s birthday on August 10, Corey Gamble mentioned the word Rav, which spurred rumours that the baby’s name is Rav. “Happy Birthday to you, One of Ones. To My Ace, who has always had my back amid these life’s tribulations I’m grateful to you, @kyliejenner,” he wrote. Big Love and HBD. And thank you for everything and my lovely grandkids! What’s up, Rav?</p><p>Fans flocked to social media to express their theories shortly after Kris’ boyfriend posted the birthday message.</p><p>“He brought up Rav. Which Rav? One commenter noted, “I immediately assumed it had something to do with the little ol’ baby’s name. A second person acknowledged, “There, I thought they were calling the son Rav.”</p><p>Others suggested that Travis’s nickname, Rav, might actually belong to Corey.</p><h3>Will Kylie Jenner Announce Her Son’s Name on ‘The Kardashians’?</h3><p>When she purported to announce her son’s name to a superfan on August 24 during a launch party for a new Kylie Cosmetics product, Kylie proceeded to tease the name of her son.</p><p>Colt Paulsen shared a video on Instagram of Kylie talking in his ear when he was at the event. As the reality star covered her mouth to keep the information hidden, lettering on the screen read, “Kylie Jenner informed me the name.”</p><p>When Kylie sang “rise and shine” at Colt’s request, it appeared that she was revealing even another piece of information about her son’s enigma name. When she sang the line to Stormi in 2019, the mother of two previously became viral.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u023979fb596dcc232114a6bbcec33aa5><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Kylie Jenner's Son's Name & First Picture Shared By Her</span></a><p>Fans flocked to the post’s comments section to guess on the baby’s name in response to Kylie’s recreation of the popular footage. Sunny is his name, lol. One message said, “Rise and shine!” Another social media user, however, correctly predicted the baby’s name would be Knight.</p><p>Fans were sure that Khloé Kardashian’s daughter, True Thompson, slipped during the season 2 debut of The Kardashians, despite the TV star admitting on The Late Late Show with James Corden alongside Kris on September 8 that she has not legally changed her son’s name.</p><p>Hello, Snowy! As her mother introduced her to her new baby brother, True stated over FaceTime. The founder of the Good American promptly clarified, “His name is not Snowy. Fans came to the immediate conclusion that True, 4, thought the newborn was her cousin Kylie’s son.</p><p>One viewer commented on the TikTok video by writing, “She’s equating the baby brother thing to Kylie’s kid since he was recently born!” It literally makes perfect sense, ” My niece actually referred to my baby as her baby sister when he was born, another person said, supporting the idea.</p><p>They “haven’t officially, legally changed the name,” Kylie said during her interview with James Corden.</p><p>“It still says Wolf on his passport. However, that won’t be his name. Just waiting right now.</p><p>On November 24, The Kardashians’ season 2 finale, which revealed when Kylie would eventually reveal the name of her son, was shown.</p><p>The makeup tycoon said, “My baby’s name is still Wolf. I’ll inform you all as soon as I make a modification. Maybe in season 3 I’ll inform you guys.”</p><p>Nothing has yet been confirmed or refuted!</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/icon-256x256-1-150x150.png alt itemprop=image sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>Divesh Solanki</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Being a binge-watcher himself, finding Content to write about comes naturally to Divesh.
