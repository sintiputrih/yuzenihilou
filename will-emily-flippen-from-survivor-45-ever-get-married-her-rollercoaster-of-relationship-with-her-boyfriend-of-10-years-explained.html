Contrary to popular belief, Emily shared that she has no plans of getting married to her boyfriend, Erik (despite just moving into their first home together), but a deleted scene from Survivor 45 shows her having a change of heart.</p><p data-characters=41 data-current-count=41 data-injectable=false>Keep scrolling to see for yourself‚Ä¶</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Emily-Flippen-and-Boyfriend.png><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-7 data-characters=456 data-current-count=797 data-injectable=true>The deleted scene posted by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a> begins with the tribe gathered around the fire for a meal, with castaways like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jake O‚ÄôKane</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Drew Basile</a> asking extremely thought-provoking questions like ‚ÄúWhat do I want to do differently in life?‚Äù&nbsp;Because of this, Emily found it to be the perfect opportunity to be vulnerable about her relationship with Erik, sharing some words that her tribemates never thought that they would hear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9>‚ÄúYou have nothing else to do out here except for think about family I guess and think about home and what‚Äôs important.
