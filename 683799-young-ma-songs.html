The Brooklyn native was part of a new wave of female hip-hop stars that emerged in the 2010s. However, her pen game and distinct cool style made her a quick favorite. The rapper remains one of hip hop’s most raw talents, and <a href=# rel>her catalog is stacked</a> with sleek flows and versatile tracks.&nbsp;</p><p>After five years of building a reputation as a fierce talent, Young M.A arrived in mainstream consciousness after <a href=# rel>her 2016 banger, “Ooouuu</a>." The song shot her to significant fame and is her most successful release so far. Young M.A's career extends beyond her music. She's a philanthropist who launched the KWEENZ foundation in honor of her mother, and even dabbled in the world of adult films when she wrote and directed <a href=# rel>The Gifted for PornHub</a>. Additionally, she's appeared on several television shows in her career including Wild N' Out, Hip-Hop Squares, and Mr. Robot. However, the musician is most famous for her skills as a rapper.&nbsp;</p><p>Between praise from rap veterans and the dedicated fanbase of loyal listeners she's procured, Young M.A's authenticity and skill set has helped distinguish her name and establish it in the industry. Though she refuses to label herself, she made it known that <a href=# rel>she is attracted to women</a>. As a result, the rapper credits coming out for making her bars more sincere, and she stated that she became more confident from speaking her truth. The following are some of Young M.A’s best hits, which have solidified her reputation as one of Hip Hop’s best female lyricists.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>11. "Hot Sauce" (2017)</h2></span><p>One of her first-ever songs, "Hot Sauce" was a glimpse into the early talents of Young M.A. as an early introduction to her talent and unique style. “Hot Sauce" demonstrates Young M.A's lyrical skills with its creative wordplay and assured flow. It is another track that called attention to her aspirations for success. “Hot Sauce” is packed with many witty liners, including, “While they making disses I'm just making hits/ 'cause if it don't make dollars it don't make no sense.”</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>10. "No Mercy (Intro)" (2018)</h2></span><p>After the success of Herstory, Young M.A had a point to prove. She doubled the strength of her cocky bars and opened up her debut album with a bang. “No Mercy (Intro)” is the first song off Herstory In The Making, and the rapper came swinging. The song features quickly spat bars and her trademark braggadocio. Effortlessly setting the scene for a memorable debut, the first track highlights Young M.A’s incredible talent as a rapper.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>9. "OOOUUU Remix" (feat. <a href=# class=text-word>50 Cent</a>) (2016)</h2></span><p>When “Ooouuu” was released, rappers far and wide released unofficial remixes to the track. From up-and-coming artists, to the likes of <a href=# class=text-word rel>Nicki Minaj</a> and <a href=# class=text-word rel>Jadakiss</a>, “Ooouuu” quickly became many listeners’ song of the summer. Despite all the famous names attached to the song, 50 Cent is the artist credited on the official remix of the song. 50 Cent’s veteran confidence paired extremely well with the then-rising star, making for an intense, brilliantly written remix of an already-established anthem.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>8. "Stubborn Ass" (2019)</h2></span><p>"Stubborn Ass" showed a much more introverted side of Young M.A. On the track, the rapper opted for a mix of vulnerability and pride, for a perfectly balanced offering. The song also continued to showcase Young M.A’s versatility and featured a more soulful beat. “Stubborn Ass” delves into the loving side of the rapper. She proved in the track that love covers a multitude of flaws, and though relationships are not perfect, there are always ways to make it work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>7. “BIG” (2019)</h2></span><p>“BIG” is one of Young M.A’s songs that show off her playful side. The track features very clever wordplay like “Yellow bone smoking purple, LA Lakers” and “Hellcat sound like Mufasa when I start it up.” With all the tough and brash songs she’s put out, Young M.A always reminds the fans that she’s able to conjure up fresh party tracks.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>6. "Self M.Ade" (2017)</h2></span><p>"Self M.Ade" is another one of Young M.A’s more personal songs. The track takes on a confessional tone and highlights the rapper’s rising success. “Self M.Ade” features details surrounding her family and faith, such as, “My mama said I ain't about a dollar, cause a dollar just a dollar, only God can make you prosper.” The song is anthemic in nature and shows off Young M.A’s introverted qualities.&nbsp;</p><p>On the track, she raps with her signature flow over a heavy bass-filled beat. She insists that she wishes to live a comfortable life with money but without fame. Young M.A also details her formula to success, which is staying in her lane and chasing her dreams.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. “Off The Yak” (2021)</h2></span><p>Young M.A has released many songs doubling down on her claims that money and success are paramount to her. The title track off her sophomore album was yet another, but with sharper lyrics and a crisper flow. As an album, Off the Yak featured an even more unflinching side to Young M.A.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. "PettyWap" (2018)</h2></span><p>"PettyWap" introduced a more fun and flirty side of the rapper. Featuring catchy hooks and a groovy production behind it, “PettyWap” is one of Young M.A’s more catchy songs. Confidence has never been an issue for the rap artist, and she takes the cockiness up a notch in the track.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. “Friendly Reminder” (2021)</h2></span><p>A standout track on her sophomore album Off the Yak, “Friendly Reminder” felt reminiscent of her 2017 song “Walk.” Young M.A let everyone listening know that she was not to be played with. She raps with an audacious flow, praising her block and crew. Young M.A was dispelling all rumors that she was broke, weak, or soft on the song. If anyone thought differently, “Friendly Reminder” was a nudge to the world that she is, in fact, very tough.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. "Walk" (2017)</h2></span><p>On “Walk”, one of Young M.A’s most brash songs, the rapper let the haters know she isn't the one to play with. She exuded raw confidence in the song, and put her haters on full blast. The upbeat song was packed with testaments to her self-assurance and bravery. Young M.A’s fearlessness on “Walk” was next to none, and she didn’t shy away from speaking her truth.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-ooouuu-2016>1. "OOOUUU" (2016)</h2></span><p>"OOOUUU" is undoubtedly Young M.A's breakout hit, and served as the catalyst that shot her to mainstream fame. The song is featured on her first EP titled Herstory. “OOOUUU” peaked at the 19th spot on the Billboard Hot 100 and has become her signature song. The single received lots of airplay upon release and became a club banger across the country.&nbsp;</p><p>However, “OOOUUU”’s biggest feat was the several unofficial remixes it spawned. Big names like Nicki Minaj, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Meek Mill</a>, Remy Ma, The Game, <a href=# class=text-word rel>French Montana</a>, and more all put their various spins on the track. This helped the single gain even more recognition, cementing the record as a cultural phenomenon and a soon-to-be-classic track.</p><p>Although Young M.A hasn't replicated the success of “OOOUUU”, her subsequent releases served to cement her status as one of Hip Hop’s best female acts. Her authenticity has garnered much praise from fans, and her unapologetic rap style earned the stamp of approval of many icons that came before her. Young M.A continues to push boundaries and impact newer artists. Her ability to shift from brash and fearless, to vulnerable, to flirty, makes her one of rap’s more recent versatile stars.&nbsp;</p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">via</a>] [<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmbYB4hZhmsKitnpx6rq2MrKann6M%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./emmys-2024-mid-tv-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;The Emmys in the Age of Gourmet Cheeseburgers</a>
