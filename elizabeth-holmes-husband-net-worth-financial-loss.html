Evans, in 1953. The company is primarily based out of San Diego, and Evans' dad, William L. Evans, was added to the management team in 1984. According to the Evans Hotels official website, the company has over 1,200 employees and its properties include:</p><ul><li>luxury boutique hotels</li><li>restaurants</li><li>wellness spas</li></ul><p>Evans' familial wealth has helped him, but he made a point of downplaying it when he got romantically involved with Elizabeth Holmes. A source close to the hotel heir told New York Post that he proposed to Holmes with an MIT insignet ring because of the financial scrutiny that Holmes was under at the time:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"He could snap his fingers and have a triple-A diamond engagement ring instantly if he wanted to.

In the source's estimation, their relationship has personal and professional benefits:</p><p>"The relationship is opportunistic for the both of them. Elizabeth needs a lot of support in her life right now, and Billy is looking for whatever way he can raise his profile."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=billy-evans-has-started-and-worked-for-several-companies-since-graduating-from-mit>Billy Evans Has Started And Worked For Several Companies Since Graduating From MIT</h2><p>Billy Evans has some professional similarities to Elizabeth Holmes, based on his education. He graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2015, and upon finishing up his studies, he decided to launch a healthcare startup for transporting Chinese people to the United States for "concierge medical attention."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/elizabeth-holmes-red-carpet.jpg><p>Elizabeth Holmes, of course, rose to prominence when she launched a healthcare startup that promised to revolutionize blood testing. Evans' plan was inspired by the time he spent abroad, studying in China, but his lack of familarity with the country's medical infrastructure, coupled with his inability to speak the language, led to the idea falling through. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A source close to the businessman confirmed the story to the New York Post</a>:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"He realized that it’s actually very hard to get in with the affluent Chinese community if you’re not fluent in Chinese, so he dropped that."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Dropout-Whats-Really-Going-On-With-Elizabeth-Holmes-Lowered-Voice.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="'The Dropout': The Truth About Elizabeth Holmes' Lowered Voice?">'The Dropout': The Truth About Elizabeth Holmes' Lowered Voice?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>It seems like Elizabeth Holmes' voice change was purposely done and for Amanda Seyfried, it was not easy to duplicate in The Dropout.</p><p>Billy Evans has bolstered his net worth by working at various high-profile companies like LinkedIn and Lumar Technologies. He was listed as a "strategy and analytics leadership program analyst" for the former, and a "manager of special projects" for the latter, though some claimed that his role at Lumar was more nebulous. A former employee claimed:</p><p>"He was a bit of a showman. He was wandering around with absolute purpose, but no one knew what that purpose was."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Evans left Lumar Technologies in 2019, with some theorizing that it was due to the negative publicity that his relationship with Elizabeth Holmes was getting. He is currently not listed as having a job on his LinkedIn profile, and when asked by The New York Times reporter Amy Chozick what he did, Evans stated: "A lot of different stuff — investing, starting companies."</p><h2 id=billy-evans-has-provided-financial-support-for-elizabeth-holmes-and-their-2-sons>Billy Evans Has Provided Financial Support For Elizabeth Holmes And Their 2 Sons</h2><p>Billy Evans has supported Elizabeth Holmes, both emotionally and financially, throughout her legal proceedings. The couple, who got married in 2019, spent months living in a lavish, 74-acre Green Gables estate in Woodside, CA. The estate was valued at an eye-watering $135 million, according to San Diego Ville, but the couple were forced to relocate after the address was leaked online.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Evans' financial support, and the timing of his relationship with Holmes, has led to some criticism from media outlets. Evans' family voiced concern over the speed with which he decided to marry and have two children with Holmes. Nick Bilton, the host of the Vanity Fair podcast Inside The Hive, theorized that Evans was footing the bill for his wife's legal costs:</p><p>"[Evans] is a trust fund baby and has a lot of money, and he's probably helping out with the legal bills because Elizabeth's family doesn't have money either."</p><p>Evans lobbied to get Holmes' prison sentence reduced, and penned a 12-page letter to judge Edward Davila ahead of sentencing. He discussed the profound effect that Holmes has had on his life, as well as:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li>The struggles Holmes had avoiding the public</li><li>The changes Holmes underwent as a mother</li><li>The difficulty that their children will face without her</li></ul><p><a href=#>Holmes is currently serving an 11-year prison sentence in Bryan, Texas</a>, and Evans currently lives in San Diego with their two sons. Evans' townhouse was purchased by his parents for a staggering $3.25 million, according to Daily Mail, and it comes complete with two bedrooms, three bathrooms and a two-car garage.
