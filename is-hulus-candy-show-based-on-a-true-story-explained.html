The pair began flirting with each other over the course of choir practices and volleyball matches until Candy asked Allan point-blank if he would have an affair with her.</p><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=317 data-injectable=false>Allan shied away initially. He still had feelings for his wife Betty, and Candy was married herself to Pat Montgomery, his fellow church member. But Allan had felt dissatisfied with his and Betty’s sex life for some time, and he quickly found himself contacting Candy in search of the sexual passion he craved.</p><p data-characters=359 data-current-count=676 data-injectable=true>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Dallas Morning News</a>, the two set up a set of rules for themselves initially.

When Betty still would not answer he asked neighbors to check on her. They discovered the couple’s daughter alive in her crib and Betty’s body in the utility room. It was in such a state that the neighbors initially believed she had been shot.</p><p data-characters=424 data-current-count=424 data-injectable=true>Texas Monthly reported later that, according to Candy’s own testimony, Betty had confronted her about the affair when she arrived to pick up the swimsuit. While she denied it at first, she finally confessed. She said Betty then walked into her garage and returned with an axe.
